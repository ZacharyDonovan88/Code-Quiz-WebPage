# Code-Quiz-WebPage

## User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Description
This is a WebPage for users to play a quiz game and add their high scores. The quiz has a 40sec timer and 4 question to complete.
If the users don't complete the quiz before the time limit the game ends. 

## What could be changed
- progress bar could be added to media query (NOTE: could not figure out how to make progress bar run in media query)
- needs more coding in media query to make the interface more cleaner
- add more questions

## Notes
WebPage has been tested and should be compatible on all supported browsers including mobile devices.
